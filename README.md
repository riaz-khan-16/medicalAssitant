This project is an intelligent chatbot application built using Django and Cohere's Large Language Model (LLM), designed to simulate the role of a virtual doctor. The chatbot interacts with users in natural language, providing health-related information, answering medical queries, and offering basic adviceâ€”emulating the communication style and knowledge base of a healthcare professional.

Key Features:
LLM Integration: Utilizes Cohereâ€™s advanced command-a-03-2025 model for generating context-aware medical responses.

Doctor Role Simulation: The LLM is primed to act as a virtual doctor, delivering informative, polite, and accurate responses to health-related questions.

Clean User Interface: A simple and responsive frontend that allows users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.

Environment Safety: Uses environment variables to securely load API keys.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Django (Python)

LLM: Cohere via langchain-cohere

Frontend: HTML/CSS + Django Forms

Deployment: Localhost or cloud-ready

ðŸ“Œ Use Case:
This application is ideal for educational or demonstration purposes, offering users an interactive experience with a medical-focused conversational AI. It can be a starting point for building more complex healthcare assistant systems with additional features like patient history, appointment booking, or symptom tracking.
